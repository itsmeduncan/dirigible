## Urban Airship for the proletariat

  An airship or dirigible is a type of aerostat or "lighter-than-air aircraft" that can be steered and
  propelled through the air using rudders and propellers or other thrust mechanisms. Unlike aerodynamic
  aircraft such as fixed-wing aircraft and helicopters, which produce lift by moving a wing through the
  air, aerostatic aircraft stay aloft by having a large "envelope" filled with a gas which is less dense
  than the surrounding atmosphere. - [Dirigible on Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dirigible)
